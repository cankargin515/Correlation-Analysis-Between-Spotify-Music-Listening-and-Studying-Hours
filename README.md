# Correlation-Analysis-Between-Spotify-Music-Listening-and-Studying-Hours
SabancÄ± University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course Fall 2024-2025 Term Project. This project analyzes the correlation between music listening hours and studying hours. 

// Project Description
In my daily life, music plays an essential role, and Spotify is my go-to platform for listening. Lately, with numerous assignments and exams demanding my focus, I've been exploring ways to enhance my productivity during study sessions. This has led me to consider whether listening to music has an impact on the amount of time I dedicate to studying. The goal of this project is to analyze and identify any potential correlation between music listening habits and the duration or efficiency of my study hours.
