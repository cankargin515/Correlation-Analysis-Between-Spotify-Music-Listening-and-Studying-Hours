# Identifying Correlation Between my Step Counts and Weather Conditions
SabancÄ± University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course Fall 2024-2025 Term Project. This project analyzes the correlation between my step counts and weather parameters.

# Project Description

Although my title is Correlation analysis between spotify music and studying hours, I decided to change project topic because my extended music history DID NOT RECEIVE to me. So my new project topic is correlation analysis between my step counts and weather data. In order not to change my link URL, I note this fact in here. To start with, walking plays an essential role in my daily life. Whenever I have a free time, I dedicate myself to walk. Walking is essential for both my physical and mental health. In this project, I'm going to analyse whether weather conditions affect my step conditions. In other words, I will analyse correlation between weather data and my step counts. 

# Dataset Description

The project involves two main datasets :

1) Step Counts by Numbers by Day by Day |
Source: Apple Health Data Application | Type: Structured | Format: XML file. Then converting this XML file to the CSV file | Key Features: Step counts by date, start and end times.
2) Weather Data |
Source: Meteostat Website, meteostat weather api | Type: Structured | Format: Excel file. Then converting it to CSV | Key Features: this cv file gives information about wind speed, temperature day by day.


# Project Plan

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
   
  -Exporting health data in terms of my daily, weekkly and hourly step counts.
  
  -Organizing weather data.
  
  -Cleaning and formatting datasets.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

   -Analyzing distributions and identifying trends.
   
   -Visualizing step numbers patterns during temperature and wind speed.

3. Correlation Analysis:
   
   -Using statistical methods to measure the correlation between my step counts and 2 weather data ( temperature and wind speed.)
   
   -Identifying significant patterns or anomalies.

4. Visualization and Insights:
   
   -Creating visual representations
   
   -Summarizing key insights.

5. Finalization and Documentation:
   
   -Compiling results into a clear and concise report.
   
   -Ensuring the repository is well-documented and ready for grading.
     
# Tools and Libraries
   - Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation
     
   - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
